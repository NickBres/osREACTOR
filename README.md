# osREACTOR

This project is a demonstration of the Reactor design pattern implemented in a simple multi-user chat server. The chat server listens for incoming client connections, accepts them, and broadcasts any messages received from a client to all other connected clients. The Reactor used in this project is provided as a shared library, which can be linked to your own programs to provide similar functionality.

All tests have been performed on a MacBook Pro with an ARM processor using the UTM virtual machine to run GCC (Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.3.0.

## Features

* Multi-user chat: The server handles multiple simultaneous client connections and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.
* Dynamic array resizing: The server dynamically resizes its arrays to accommodate increasing numbers of clients.
* Signal handling: The server properly cleans up resources when it receives an interrupt or terminate signal.
* Reactor design pattern: The server uses the Reactor design pattern to handle events generated by multiple clients. This means that it doesn't waste CPU cycles polling clients that have no new messages. Instead, it uses the OS's ability to "react" to events such as new client connections or incoming messages.
* Shared library: The Reactor functionality is provided as a shared library, which can be linked to your own C programs.

> Please note that this library is not thread-safe. If you're planning on using it in a multi-threaded application, you'll need to add your own synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and other concurrency issues
## How to use

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/NickBres/osREACTOR.git
  cd osREACTOR/
  make
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ./server
   ```
After server is running you can connect to it using a TCP/IP client (like netcat or telnet). (Simple client example also included)
